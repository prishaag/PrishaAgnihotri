            <p> As you may have guessed, I'm passionate about coding and software development. Beyond the screen, I lead an active lifestyle, enjoying activities like hiking, swimming, and running. Exploring new destinations is a big part of my life â€“ there's nothing like the thrill of travel and experiencing diverse cultures. Now, when it comes to food, I'm a vegetarian, which adds an interesting twist to my culinary adventures. One dish I absolutely adore is ramen, and I make it a point to discover the finest vegetarian options wherever I go. In a nutshell, I'm all about the world of programming, outdoor adventures, and savoring delicious dishes. It's a diverse mix that keeps life interesting! </p>

                    <h4> StoryGen</h4>
                    <p> My friends and I built a Node.js/React Native interactive learning app for children during the MHacks Hackathon. The app generates stories based on the input of the child using the app- if they want a story about dinosaurs and rainbows, they will have it! We've used the ChatGPT API, NLP, as well as some text to speech packages to help children listen, read, and learn syntax for their generated story. Building this app was so fun- it was a great first app to build!  </p>

                    <p> 
                        During my freshman year, I participated in ENGR 100 Robotics Mechanisms, a course I now TA! In this class, my team built a submarine prototype with temperature and pressure sensors to address water pollution, a crucial global issue. We designed a ballast system using a syringe and motor for depth control, collecting precise data through oversampling. Our project was super cool, and I really enjoyed working on it.

                    <p> Sophomore year, first semester, I enrolled in a data-oriented programming class. The final project for this class was to pick three APIs to work with, by storing information and analyzing it. My team worked with spotify, youtube, and the billboard top 100! We stored the information we gathered in an SQL database. I learned a lot about APIs and SQL through this project, both of which were new concepts to me this semester.

                        Euchre, a notoriously famous project in our introductory data structures class, challenged me to code multiple files for card valuation, player actions, and strategic moves to play against a bot. This project taught me classes, object-oriented programming, and game logic intricacies. It was both challenging and rewarding, enhancing my programming skills and problem-solving capabilities. While I can't share the code due to my university's honor code, I'm open to discussing and sharing more about the experienceâ€”feel free to reach out!</p>

                    <h4> Ping Pong</h4>
                    <p> I wanted to learn python, so I started on a project to do so! With the help of a youtube video, I was able to learn Python, and write a script for two players to play ping pong. I used the Pygame framework, which allowed me to work with computer keys pretty easily. This project was super helpful in teaching me what a class was, and how and why to use one. There was a lot of math involved in this project, much of which the tutorial went over, but I learned so much! Take a look at my rendition of the game down below!</p>

                    <h4> Machine Learning</h4>
                    <p> In order to be accepted into one of my clubs on an advanced tier, I had to complete a machine learning challenge of my choice. We were given a dataset to work with, and I chose to use KNN and Random Forest models to try and accurately analyze and predict the data. The models I created ended up being pretty accurate, but not perfect. This was the first time I had ever done ML, and it was super fun!
